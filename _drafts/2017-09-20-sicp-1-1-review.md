title: SICP Section 1.1 - The Elements of Programming
---

This is the first of what I hope to be a total of 22 posts on SICP - each post corresponding to a section of the book. These posts serve to discuss interesting points, and to provide a recap of problem sets that I found interesting.

In other words, I'm effectively borrowing [Eli Bendersky's idea](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/tag/sicp){:target="_blank"}, but I won't go to the depth he has with his posts.
