title: SICP section 1.1 - The Elements of Programming
---

This is the first of what I hope to be a total of 22 posts on SICP - each post corresponding to a section of the book. In these posts, my aim is to discuss points and exercises that I find to be particularly insightful and/or interesting.

In other words, I'm plagiarising [Eli Bendersky's idea](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/tag/sicp){:target="_blank"}, but I won't go to the depth he has with his posts.
