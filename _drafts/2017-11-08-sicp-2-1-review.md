title: SICP section 2.1 - introduction to data abstraction

{% include sicp.html exercises='2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, 2.09, 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15' %}

Section 2.1.3 (which includes exercises 2.04 - 2.06) was quite the eye-opener! The authors state that:

> In general, we can think of data as defined by some collection of selectors and constructors, together with specified conditions that these procedures must fulfil in order to be a valid representation.

Thus, any implementation of `cons`, `car` and `cdr` can be used as a basis for implementing pairs, as long as they satisfy the condition that: for any `x` and `y`, if `z` is `(cons x y)`, then `(car z)` is `x`, and `(cdr z)` is `y`.

## Exercise 2.04
So hey, why not implement `cons`, `car` and `cdr` using lambdas?
