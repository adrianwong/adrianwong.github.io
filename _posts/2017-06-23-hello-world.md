This site previously served as a portfolio - I actively avoided blogging because I felt that I had nothing valuable to contribute to the already-abundant wealth of programming knowledge on the interwebs.

Well, I'm avoiding it no more! I've decided to approach blogging with a different mindset - that it can be a good vehicle for learning and for improving my writing skills. The approach I intend to take is as follows:

1. Take something I've learned, and attempt to distil it.
2. Document this distillation clearly and concisely.
3. Post it, however terrible it might be. 
4. Repeat! Keep moving forward. [Fire and motion](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/01/06/fire-and-motion/){:target="_blank"}.

So. With all that said - first post, done!

(This actually took a lot longer to write than I thought it would...)
