Hey there! I'm Adrian, a Melbourne-based software developer currently working for [PaperCut](https://www.papercut.com). In my free time I enjoy reading, playing the guitar, and watching reruns of Bear Grylls' [Man vs. Wild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_vs._Wild).

In a previous life I worked in the coal mines, toiling away with my trusty pickaxe and canary. What inspired me to switch careers was a desire to make a living in a field I've always had a fascination for.

In here you'll find a collection of stuff I've worked / am working on. Opinions are strictly my own.
